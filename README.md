## üìñ Project Overview

This project demonstrates **Structure from Motion (SfM)**, a computer vision technique that reconstructs 3D structures from a sequence of 2D images or video frames. The goal is to generate a 3D point cloud representing the scene, leveraging feature detection, matching, and optimization techniques.

Our approach uses modern feature detectors like **SuperPoint**, feature matchers such as **FlannBasedMatcher**, and robust optimization techniques to refine 3D reconstruction. By calibrating the camera and processing the images, we create point clouds that visualize the scene's spatial structure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach

1. **Feature Extraction**: Detect keypoints in images using detectors like **SIFT** or **SuperPoint**.
2. **Feature Matching**: Match corresponding keypoints between consecutive images using **BFMatcher** or **FlannBasedMatcher**.
3. **Camera Calibration**: Use the provided calibration matrix for precise measurements.
4. **Structure Reconstruction**: Solve for camera poses and triangulate points to generate the 3D structure.
5. **Optimization  (Optional)**: Refine the reconstruction using techniques like bundle adjustment for accuracy.
